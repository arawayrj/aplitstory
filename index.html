                              The boy, whose name is Santiago, stood facing death as he tried desperately to turn himself into the wind. Considering the words of the Alchemist, he reached out to the spirits of the world. He tried first with the desert, but alas, the desert could not turn him into the wind despite its willingness. It did, however, let him know that he should talk to the wind. The boy listened and tried his luck with the wind. Santiago managed to annoy the wind to the point where it picks up considerably. Eventually, a sandstorm was created so the boy could speak to the sun without going blind. The sun also was unable to transform Santiago into the wind, so it suggested that he speak to the Hand That Wrote All. Santiago prayed instead of speaking, but eventually saw that the soul of the Hand That Wrote All was within himself. He managed to disappear then reappear on the opposite side of the camp he was being held at, thus securing his life as well as the Alchemist’s.

                          Santiago was not always the pseudo-alchemist that he became when he turned himself into the wind. He began his journey as a simple shepherd in the fields of Andalusia. This  region of Spain was regarded as one of the most beautiful places around the land. Santiago's father was puzzled when Santiago asked to leave, because he know that people come from all around the world to live where they had lived. The women were more beautiful and the crops were more full. He starts out as a boy who just follows his sheep, a passive observer of life. This contrasts with his eventual end state of being in complete control of himself, but more on that later. Somewhat content with life, Santiago began having a dream that would return each night he slept under a specific tree that had sprouted up from the ruins of a church. It fed into his hunger for exploration that he had harbored for some time. In the dream, he was told about a treasure located in egypt, and he was told that it was his to find. Santiago desperately wanted to make sense of this dream. Eventually, Santiago decided to ask a gypsy to interpret his dream, but seemed dissatisfied with the results, as she basically told him he must travel to the pyramids, which was something he probably could have guessed himself.

                          Santiago’s treasure that he was headed towards was revealed to be his Personal Legend by someone called Melchizedek, who is one of the pieces along Santiago’s journey that guided him by offering insight as to how Santiago should act. In the city of Tarifa, Santiago met the mysterious being who called himself Melchizedek, the King of Salem. At first, Santiago was understandably wary of this man who claimed to be a king. Initially annoyed at the old man for pestering him with questions about his book, the man proved to the boy that he could read, and in fact had read the very book the boy was holding in his hands. As the boy looked down on those who couldn’t read, by striking up a conversation about the book Santiago had with him, Melchizedek was able to convince Santiago to take him seriously, since an old man who could read was more likely a king than an old man who couldn’t. Eventually, Melchizedek informed Santiago of the importance of a concept known as the Personal Legend. Santiago seemed to enjoy the idea of a personal legend, since it gave meaning to his life - although Santiago enjoyed traveling with his sheep, he believed what would make him truly happy would be finding some greater truth or meaning. The king explains that the Personal Legend is essentially someone’s ultimate dream or goal, something that every person innately wants to accomplish. Over time, however, people become less and less aware of what their personal legend is, for an unknown reason. As Melchizedek puts it, everyone, when they are young, knows what their Personal Legend is. At that point in their lives, everything is clear and everything is possible. They are not afraid to dream, and to yearn for everything they would like to see happen to them in their lives. But, as time passes, a mysterious force begins to convince them that it would be impossible for them to realize their Personal Legend.
                          Melchizedek elaborated on how the key to pursuing one’s Personal Legend is to follow one’s heart, as he explained to Santiago, and to ignore the outside influences that may try to change him. As an example, he brings up the baker across the street, who ends up abandoning his Personal Legend of traveling because he believes a baker is a more important profession. Santiago considers this and the thought of remaining a shepherd, compared with being able to travel freely like the wind, and thought about buying a ticket aboard a boat to Africa.
                          Melchizedek was able to finally convince Santiago with a story of a boy who was sent to learn from the wisest man in the world, whom the boy finds inside a beautiful castle. The wise man tells the boy to carry a spoon of oil through the castle, and not to spill a drop. The boy succeeds in the task, but when he tells the man that he did not see a single thing in the wonderful castle, he is made to repeat the task. This time, he sees many amazing things, but has spilled all the oil in the spoon. Santiago understood this to mean that while he should go out to look at the world, he must never forget the things close to him, just as a shepherd may travel but must never forget his flock.

                          After arriving in Tangier, Morocco, Santiago is robbed for all the money he earned by selling his sheep. Although he is initially distraught by this setback, he is reassured and encouraged by the king’s words: when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it. Now more determined than ever, Santiago happens upon a crystal shop. The shop owner offers Santiago a job working for him in order to make money for his trip to Egypt, as he considered Santiago a good omen. Throughout their year of working, Santiago and the crystal merchant had profound effects on each other. Santiago was able to greatly increase business, by first building a display case to put outside the store in order to attract more customers, and then coming up with the idea of selling tea within crystal glasses. In both cases, he was met with reluctance from the crystal merchant, who did not understand why one would undertake risk for uncertain reward, especially when things are already good enough.
                          This is the same philosophy that the crystal merchant uses when it comes to his life. Unlike Santiago, who wanted to pursue his personal legend so he can be happy, the crystal merchant was unwilling to pursue his own dreams for fear that once he succeeds, he will have nothing left to live for. Indeed, he believed that he would be happiest among what he is most familiar with, which is selling crystal. At that point, he thought, there was no point in travelling to Mecca, where his Personal Legend was leading him him, as he may as well live out the rest of his life the way he has been living it. Soon after Santiago leaves the crystal merchant for Egypt, the crystal merchant became rather upset. He reflected on how Santiago had been able to quickly turn his business around by taking a few risks, and he thinks of how much happier he could have been had he stepped outside his comfort zone and went to pursue his Personal Legend.
                          Santiago, on the other hand, recognizes the crystal merchant as an example of why one experience new things in order to grow. He reflects on this fact when he considers his sheep - although his sheep are able to teach Santiago a great many things, he has learned just as much in his time away from them, things that his sheep could never have taught him. Armed with this conclusion, is more convinced that his choice in pursuing his Personal Legend is something that he must do.

                          While in AL-Fayoum, Santiago meets Fatima. He finds love at first sight, and it is described as: ”At that moment, it seemed to him that time stood still, and the Soul of the World surged within him. When he looked into her dark eyes, and saw that her lips were poised between a laugh and silence, he learned the most important part of the language that all the world spoke—the language that everyone on earth was capable of understanding in their heart. It was love.” Fatima plays an important part in Santiago's journey, she is a guiding figure, but she is also is his motivation. Santiago wanted to give everything up and live with her forever, but she said that he must pursue this dream, and his personal legend. She describes there love like the desert, by saying “the dunes are changed by the wind, but the desert never changes” she also tells him “if I am truly apart of your dream, then you will come back”. Santiago loves her, and respects her when she pushes him to pursue his legend. He goes on to pursue it and thinks of her through it all, and cannot wait until they a reunited.
